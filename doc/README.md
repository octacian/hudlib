# API Documentation
HUDLib provides a rather extensive yet simplistic API for use in third party mods. The API is mainly divided into different files depending on the type of HUD element, however, there is one main file (`api.lua`) containing code suitable for all types of HUDs. Below an overview of each documentation file can be found.

### API.md
The main API (`api.lua`) registers but a few functions allowing you to do things like view all the HUD elements attached to a player no matter their type or execute some code after a specific amount of time

### HUD.md
This documents the API provided by `hud.lua` which currently indirectly supports all HUD elements.
