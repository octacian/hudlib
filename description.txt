HUDLib aims to create a very simple and easy to use API in front of a powerful and complex backend. Sure, there are other mods that introduce APIs to simplify HUD development, but they all focus on some type of statbar (used for things like health) and don't support other HUD elements. However, HUDLib will support all available HUD elements (including statbars and waypoints), wrapping them in an API built to lessen the amount of code you need to make your HUD not only look nice but also be functional.
